You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.

Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

Solution:-

import string

def solve(s):
    
    for x in s.split():
        s = s.replace(x, x.capitalize())
    return(s)
