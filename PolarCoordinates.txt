Polar coordinates are an alternative way of representing Cartesian coordinates or Complex Numbers.

A complex number 
   X + IJ
is completely determined by its real part X and imaginary part I .
Here, I is the imaginary unit.

Solutions:-

import cmath
a = complex((input()))
print(abs(complex(a)))
print(cmath.phase(a))
